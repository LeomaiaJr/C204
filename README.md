# C204 Algorithms III

Welcome to the repository for the **C204 Algorithms III** university subject at [**Inatel**](https://inatel.br/home/). In this repository, I've organized the materials based on the different topics covered during the first semester of the year 2023 in the C204 Algorithms III subject at Inatel University. Below is a description of each folder:

## AlgoritmosDeBusca

This folder contains implementations and explanations of various search algorithms. You'll find code examples for linear search, binary search, and other related algorithms. Feel free to explore the code to understand how each algorithm functions and how it can be applied to different scenarios.

## AlgoritmosGeometricos

In the **AlgoritmosGeometricos** folder, you'll find resources related to geometric algorithms. These algorithms are designed to solve problems involving geometric shapes and structures. This folder provides implementations and explanations for algorithms like calculating areas, determining intersections, and solving other geometric puzzles.

## ArvoresBinarias

The **ArvoresBinarias** folder is dedicated to binary trees. Here, you'll find information about various types of binary trees, including binary search trees and AVL trees. This section covers their definitions, properties, and implementations. Dive into the code to understand how these trees organize data and facilitate efficient data retrieval.

## NP1 & NP2

The NP1 & NP2 folders contain materials, instructions, and code related to first and second tests of the course.
